The process in poducing this draft, I have met some problems, the first one is while I recorded the shots, I must record a lot of times because I want to have the perfect one and I have to arrange and insert the shots approriately after I recorded it, I must cut align the shots in order to make it smooth and beautiful. The final problem is the music, I have to go to many websites so as to find a suitable music because I want my video look flexible, I have to use many kind of musics that help me convey my emotions to everyone. In the end, everything is still perfect. I was able to create the draft that I am most satisfied with, but since it's still a draft, I still have to make a few adjustments.
