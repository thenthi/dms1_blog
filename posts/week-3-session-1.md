The process in poducing this draft, I had met some problems, the first one was while I recorded the shots, I must record a lot of times because I wanted to have the perfect one and I had to arrange and insert the shots approriately after I recorded it, I must cut align the shots in order to make it smooth and beautiful. The final problem was the music, I had to go to many websites so as to find a suitable music because I wanted my video look flexible, I had to use many kind of musics that helped me conveyed my emotions to everyone. In the end, everything was still perfect. I was able to create the draft that I was most satisfied with, but since it was still a draft, I still had to make a few adjustments.
