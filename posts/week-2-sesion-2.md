A key moment in my planned two minutes sequence for Assignment 1 is at 1 minute and 16 seconds because in this moment, I had to change my scene. Moreover, this moment proved that it was when my life turned a new page.

This moment is the main element in my assignment, before this moment I used the sound like funny, excited or enthusiastic to show my effort at present (my visual elements that I added to the video look energetic) and then turn to this moment the music sounds liked it was full of happiness and contentment with life. (the shots that I added at this moment mean that I will have succeeded in the future=> so I feel happy). 

The emotional tone of broader portrait before the moment was joy and playfullness (it alsao had warmth and serenity) and in order to support that tone, I also used soft, upbeat and energetic music combnined with colorful shots (warm sunshine and beautiful places).When we turned to this moment, the emotional tone of broader portrait was power and confidence. I also built the image of a mature, independent woman who was successful in her career. And for the final shots the emotional tone was energy and ambition,the image of me was filled with hope in the future.

For the connection between the shots in this moment is that I wanted the audiences know that I was trying to express the beginning of my new life=> it meant that this was the first time I had to study far form my house, by myself and I could not live with my parents. So, I wanted the audiences realise that before 1 minute and 16 seconds, the sound and shots becomed more fun, lively, and full of passion => I am trying my best to study and from there I can become a person I want to be in the future (at 1 minute and 16 seconds). My life had changed, I had done my study, started working by myself =>the music became calm and cheerful combined with the shots, it was the evidence that I succeded. I tried to forge the connection between present and future, the effort that I had now, it would be rewarded in the future. 

I tried to establish the fast pace, yet with a touch of enjoyment, not overwhelming. For my editing, I just tried to find shots and musics that was suitable for the tempo I wanted and then arranged it appropriately (cut video, music section and then combined it together ). Moreover, I also used some scene transition techniques to help the audiences feel the rhythm more clearly.
