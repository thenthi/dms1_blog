A key moment in my planned two minutes sequence for Assignment 1 is at 1 minute and 16 seconds because in this moment, I have to change my scene. Moreover, this moment prove that it was when my life turned a new page.

This moment is the main element in my assignment, before this moment I use the sound like funny, excited or enthusiastic to show my effort at present (my visual elements that I add to the video look energetic) and then turn to this moment the music sounds like it's full of happiness and contentment with life. (the shots that I add at this moment means that I will have succeeded in the future=> so I feel happy). 

The emotional tone of broader portrait before the moment is joy and playfullness (it alsao have warmth and serenity) and in order to support that tone, I also use soft, upbeat and energetic music combnine with colorful shots (warm sunshine and beautiful places).When we turn to this moment, the emotional tone of broader portrait is power and confidence. I also build the image of a mature, independent woman who is successful in her career. And for the final shots the emotional tone is energy and ambition,the image of me is filled with hope in the future.

For the connection between the shots in this moment is that I want the audiences know that I am trying to express the beginning of my new life=> it means that this is the first time I have to study far form my house, by myself and I can not live with my parents. So, I want the audiences realise that before 1 minute and 16 seconds, the sound and shots become more fun, lively, and full of passion => I am trying my best to study and from there I can become a person I want to be in the future (at 1 minute and 16 seconds). My life have changed, I have done my study, start working by myself =>the music become calm and cheerful combine with the shots, it is the evidence that I succeded. I try to forge the connection between present and future, the effort that I have now, it will be rewarded in the future. 

I try to establish the fast pace, yet with a touch of enjoyment, not overwhelming. For my editing, I just try to find shots and musics that is suitable for the tempo I want and then arrange it appropriately (cut video, music section and then combine it together ). Moreover, I also use some scene transition techniques to help the audiences feel the rhythm more clearly.
