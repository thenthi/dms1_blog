A key moment in my planned two minutes sequence for Assignment 1 is at the 30th-second because in this moment, I have to change my scene. Moreover, this moment prove that it was when my life turned a new page.

In this two minutes sequence, I used two sounds, the first one is the sound make us feel calm and at ease (the sound that mark the beginning of a new day) => it menas when I have a new life in Melbourne when I decided to study abroad in there. The second one was the scence change to beatiful scenery that I recorded when I come to Australia so the sound is really funny and sounds that evok a love for life. Futhermore, it also caries a sense of curiosity and inspiration about the life of an Australian international student. This is the reason why I recorded the scenery and combine with the inspirational sound.

For the connection between the shots in this moment is that I want the audience know that I am trying to express the beginning of my new life=> it means that this is the first time I have to study far form my house, by myself and I can not live with my parents. Everything is completely new to me( new frineds, a new environment, and even foregin teachers ). So, I want the audience know that at the 30th-second, the sound and shots become more fun, lively, and cheerful => I am trying my best to study and from there I can become a person I want to be in the future. Moreover the connection that I trying to forge is that the new life in Australia
