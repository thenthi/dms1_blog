A key moment in my planned two minutes sequence for Assignment 1 is at the 30th-second because in this moment, I have to change my scene. Moreover, this moment prove that it was when my life turned a new page.
In this two minutes sequence, I used two sounds, the first one is the sound make us feel calm and at ease (the sound that mark the beginning of a new day) => it menas when I have a new life in Melbourne when I decided to study abroad in there. The second one was the scence change to beatiful scenery that I recorded when I come to Australia so the sound is really funny and sounds that evok a love for life. Futhermore, it also caries a sense of curiosity and inspiration about the life of an Australian international student.
