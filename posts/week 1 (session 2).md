This is a video that I use the basic editing techniques from class. It's all very new to me, this is the first time I've been exposed to the Adobe Premiere Pro application so I can't understand it clearly. I had to learn how to use it on many websites and discovered a few more tools for video editing myself. Although I met some problems while I did this video, I also found solutions to solve them by myself and assitances from teacher. I hope that in the future I can use it professionally, create a beautiful video, show it for everyone to see. I see myself completing this exercise only about 50% because there are still many editing techniques I still don't know and apply. I will try my best to explore and understand it thoroughly.
