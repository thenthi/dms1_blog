This is a video that I used the basic editing techniques from class. It was all very new to me, this was the first time I had been exposed to the Adobe Premiere Pro application so I couldn't understand it clearly. I had to learn how to use it on many websites and discovered a few more tools for video editing myself. Although I met some problems while I did this video, I also found solutions to solve them by myself and assitances from teacher. I hoped that in the future I could use it professionally, created a beautiful video, showed it for everyone to see. I saw myself completing this exercise only about 50% because there were still many editing techniques I still didn't know and apply. I will try my best to explore and understand it thoroughly.
