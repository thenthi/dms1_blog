On my storyboard, for the first 8 shots in my storyboard I want to show the audience my daily life, how my life start in Melbourne. Therefore, in these shots I try to establish and mantain continuity, there are a sequence of continuos activities such as wake up, strecth(breath in the air), boil water, drink water and then study. Then, I use discontinuity to move to the next shots, there are a lot of beautiful sceneries that I used to record in Australia, both Melbourne and Sydney. In these shots, I want to express that I have a new life in Melbourne, everything was new for me, I decided to study abroad in there, so I try my best to study => the scenes that I recorded myself (turn on the computer, choose books, etc,...). Moving to the shot that have a train go through (it means like the time pass into the future)=>in this shot, I continue to use discontinuity in my work because I have to move myself in different situation, I grow up and I get my dream job =>the shots show that I am going to work and I have presentation (I want to show the audience that I want to become a web designer and show my website to people). And the final shots, I still use discontinuity to present the audience that I suddenly wake up after a g√¥d dream (it not only my dream but also it actually my dream job and who I want to become in future). After a dream, I feel happy and satisfied because in my dream, I was able to do the job i've always dreamed of.
