On my storyboard, for the first 8 shots in my storyboard I wanted to show the audience my daily life, how my life started in Melbourne. Therefore, in these shots I tried to establish and mantain continuity, there were a sequence of continuos activities such as wake up, strecth(breath in the air), boil water, drink water and then study. Then, I used discontinuity to move to the next shots, there were a lot of beautiful sceneries that I used to record in Australia, both Melbourne and Sydney. In these shots, I wanted to express that I have a new life in Melbourne, everything was new for me, I decided to study abroad in there, so I tried my best to study => the scenes that I recorded myself (turn on the computer, choose books, etc,...). Moving to the shot that have a train went through (it meant like the time pass into the future)=>in this shot, I continued to use discontinuity in my work because I had to move myself in different situation, I grew up and I got my dream job =>the shots showed that I was going to work and I had presentation (I wanted to show the audience that I hoped to become a web designer and showed my website to people). And the final shots, I still used discontinuity to present the audience that I suddenly woke up after a good dream (it was not only my dream but also it was actually my dream job and who I wanted to become in future). After a dream, I felt happy and satisfied because in my dream, I was able to do the job I had always dreamed of.

The viewer could see that the way I edited the video start with a beautiful and peaceful morning, then next shots I continued with beautiful scenes full of energy and zest for life. After that, I wanted to show to the viewer that now I was trying to explore and learn very much and then I finally succeded with the shots I went to work, fulfilled my dream became a web designer. Finally, the last shots shifted to a peaceful morning and I woke up after a nap I took while doing the assignments. Therefore, the way I edited like that I wanted to talk about how my day start, the experience that I had in Melbourne, now I am trying to study very much in order to carry out my dream job become a person that I want to be in a few years time. Therefore, the emotions that I wanted to offer the viewer was happiness, inspiration, effort and alsao satisfaction. I hope that when they watch my video they can feel the same emotions like me.
