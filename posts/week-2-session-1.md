On my storyboard, for the first 8 shots in my storyboard I want to show the audience my daily life, how my life start in Melbourne. Therefore, in these shots I try to establish and mantain continuity, there are a sequence of continuos activities such as wake up, strecth(breath in the air), boil water, drink water and then study. Then, I use discontinuity to move to the next shots, there are a lot of beautiful sceneries that I used to record in Australia, both Melbourne and Sydney. In these shots, I want to express that I have a new life in Melbourne, everything was new for me, I decided to study abroad in there, so I try my best to study => the scenes that I recorded myself (turn on the computer, choose books, etc,...). Moving to the shot that have a train go through (it means like the time pass into the future)=>in this shot, I continue to use discontinuity in my work because I have to move myself in different situation, I grow up and I get my dream job =>the shots show that I am going to work and I have presentation (I want to show the audience that I want to become a web designer and show my website to people). And the final shots, I still use discontinuity to present the audience that I suddenly wake up after a g√¥d dream (it not only my dream but also it actually my dream job and who I want to become in future). After a dream, I feel happy and satisfied because in my dream, I was able to do the job I've always dreamed of.

The viewer can see that the way I edit the video start with a beautiful and peaceful morning, then next shots I continue with beautiful scenes full of energy and zest for life. After that, I want to show to the viewer that now I am trying to explore and learn very much and then I finally success with the shots I go to work, fulfill my dream become a web designer. Finally, the last shots shift to a peaceful morning and I wake up after a nap I took while doing the assignments. Therefore, the way I edit like that I want to talk about how my day start, the experience that I have in Melbourne, now I try to study very much in order to carry out my dream job become a person that I want to be in a few years time. Therefore, the emotions that I want to offer the viewer is happiness, inspiration, effort and alsao satisfaction. I hope that when they watch my video they can feel the same emotions like me.
